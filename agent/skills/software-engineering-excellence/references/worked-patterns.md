# Worked patterns

Concrete, stack-agnostic illustrations of each principle — what it looks like when it is present, and the shape of its absence. None of these is tied to a particular language, framework, or project; they are the recurring patterns that separate work at the bar from work that merely compiles.

## 1. Ground in current reality

**Present:** A task points at a specific failing test and includes the command to reproduce it. The engineer runs *that command* first, watches the actual failure, and only then forms a theory — discovering the real fault is in a different code path than the title suggested.
**Absent:** The engineer reconstructs the scenario from the title, hits a *different* failure, and treats it as confirmation — fixing a problem the task was not about while the real one remains. Or: the engineer reports a metric from a previous run as current, not noticing a change has since landed and the picture has moved.

## 2. Reuse before you create

**Present:** Before adding a tree-walking helper, the engineer searches and finds the same walk implemented thirteen times across the test suite, confirms each copy is behaviorally identical, and consolidates them into one shared helper — deleting twelve copies and the divergence risk with them.
**Absent:** A new near-copy of an existing function is added because it was faster than finding the original — creating a second place every future bug must be fixed, and a second behavior that will silently drift from the first.

## 3. Production-ready (work → fast → pretty)

**Present:** A new low-level library is built to the full protocol, then benchmarked head-to-head against the established reference implementations in other languages (not in a vacuum), then validated for byte-level interoperability against those references — and only called done once it matches them on correctness *and* is competitive on speed.
**Absent:** "It passes the basic case" is declared done, with the uncommon-but-real paths left unhandled and performance never measured against anything — so "works" means "works on the one input I tried," and the slow path surfaces in production.

## 4. Validate to the real bar

**Present:** Performance has regressed over several weeks. Rather than guess at a cause, the engineer rebuilds at successive historical points, bisects to the exact change that introduced the cost, and root-causes it to a specific per-operation overhead — then verifies the fix across *both* execution modes the system supports, not just the default.
**Absent:** A platform-specific CI failure that cannot be reproduced locally is "fixed" by lowering an optimization level or skipping the test — an environmental workaround that buries the real defect instead of tracing the platform-specific code path that actually differs.

## 5. Right value for the right things

**Present:** A review flags that a command-line flag does nothing. Instead of wiring it up, the engineer asks who actually wants it — finds no caller, no doc, and no workflow that uses it — and removes it. The right diff was deletion, not implementation.
**Absent:** The flag is dutifully made to work "as advertised," adding a surface, a code path, and a maintenance burden for a capability nobody needs — answering "is the fix correct?" when the real question was "should this exist at all?"

## 6. Hold the line under uncertainty

**Present:** A proposed fix is rejected. The engineer's next move is not another proposal but a return to the code — reading the constraints properly, mapping the real option space — and only then bringing back a grounded recommendation. Separately, when asked "does this change mean the other one isn't needed?", the engineer *answers the question* and waits, rather than taking it as an instruction to start reverting things.
**Absent:** A rejection triggers a burst of four alternatives in four minutes, each one only dodging the previous objection without understanding the problem, each worse than the last. Or: a clarifying question is misread as a command, and the engineer closes work and rebuilds on the strength of something the human only *asked about*.

## Structure over the quick fix

**Present:** A bug surfaces as a wrong value at the UI. Rather than clamp it where it shows, the engineer traces it to a shared calculation two layers down, finds the same wrong assumption feeding three other call sites, and fixes it at that layer — so the reported symptom and two latent ones disappear together and the structure is sounder than before. The change is small; it just lands at the *right layer*.
**Absent:** The value is clamped at the display, the ticket closed, and the same fault keeps re-emerging elsewhere — each patched locally, each leaving the codebase a little more irregular, until no one can say where the real calculation lives. Nothing was ever obviously broken enough to stop for; the bar simply drifted down one accepted patch at a time.

## Investigation: evidence over story

**Present:** Asked whether another engine supports a feature, the engineer reads that engine's parser gates, default config, and tests rather than its marketing — and reports that the feature exists but is flagged off by default and untested, a materially different answer than "supported." The recommendation comes after that record and traces to it.
**Absent:** The engineer repeats the other project's README claim as fact, or leads with a recommendation and back-fills evidence that flatters it — and when corrected, flips the conclusion without re-reading the source, so the second answer is no better grounded than the first.

## Prove it end-to-end first (the walking skeleton)

**Present:** A new service starts as the thinnest path that runs all the way through — a request in, through every real layer, a trivial response out — deployed to a live-like environment on day one. The auth boundary, the data layer, and the deploy pipeline are all present but nearly empty. Every later feature lands on something that already runs and ships, and the integration mismatches surface early as small notes instead of late rewrites.
**Absent:** Each layer is built to completion in isolation — a polished data model, then a full service layer, then the API — and only wired together near the end. The first real end-to-end run happens late, under deadline, and exposes a mismatch between layers everyone thought was finished; the deploy path, untouched until then, fails in its own ways at the worst possible moment.

## The thread through all of them

In every "absent" case above, the engineer made a silent call it was not entitled to make: that the title was the spec, that a near-copy was fine, that "works once" was done, that a workaround was a fix, that a surface should exist, that a question was a command. In every "present" case, reality was consulted first and uncertainty was surfaced rather than improvised. That is the whole skill in one line: **work to the defined bar, and when the bar is not defined for your situation, surface the question instead of inventing the answer.**
